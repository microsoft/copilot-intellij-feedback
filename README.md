## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Before filing a new issue, try these common solutions:

### Copilot tool window stuck on "Initializing..."

This often indicates a compatibility or dependency issue:

1. **Check plugin compatibility**: Ensure your IDE version is compatible with your Copilot plugin version
2. **Update to stable version**: If using a nightly build, try the latest stable release
3. **Verify dependencies**: Ensure the Kotlin plugin is enabled and up-to-date
4. **Restart IDE**: Sometimes a simple restart resolves initialization issues
5. **Check logs**: Enable [debug logging](https://github.com/microsoft/copilot-intellij-feedback/wiki/Enable-debug-logging) to identify specific errors

### ClassNotFoundException or NoClassDefFoundError

These errors typically indicate missing dependencies or version incompatibilities:

1. **Update IDE**: Ensure your JetBrains IDE is fully updated
2. **Update plugin**: Use the latest stable plugin version from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot)
3. **Check Kotlin plugin**: Verify the Kotlin plugin is installed and enabled
4. **Clear caches**: Try File â†’ Invalidate Caches and Restart

### Plugin not working after update

1. **Restart IDE**: Always restart after plugin updates
2. **Check authentication**: Verify you're still signed in to GitHub Copilot
3. **Re-enable plugin**: Try disabling and re-enabling the Copilot plugin
4. **Downgrade if needed**: If issues persist, consider reverting to a previous stable version
